# Face Vision Sumrize System 

## OverView
This project is the Summmary of all kind of algorithms. The dataset of figure and emotion is grabbed by the spider rebot. We realized image defection \ 
and recoginzation through all kinds of image defection algorithms, such as CNN(cyclic neural network), SVM(support vector machine), and CV2 and so on. 
By comparing the difference among these algotithms, We can find many interesting things.

## Content
The following is the struct of the project.

> **Explain**:
> Emotion_recgo: the directory of relaizing the Emotion recogition.
>        the files in the directory can be easily distinguished by the end of these file name (with+way).                
> FaceDection: the directory of realizing the face dection.
         the files in the directory can be easily distinguished by the end of these file name (with+way).  
> Other directory and files is conducted  in the progress of the project. some of them are temp file. other is trained model and so on.
